# Code Refactor Challenge

In this challenge I replaced all non-semantic HTML elements with semantic elements. I then consolidated and commented the CSS file. 
I also added alt text to the images. 

# IMPORTANT NOTICE

My SSH keys were malfunctioning due to having multiple github accounts and projects. As such I had to start over with the version control aspect of this challenge and as such, there is only one commit. In the future I will show my work over several commits.

Thanks.
